As a result, doctors and other health professionals have sometimes harmed patients instead of helping them. It is essential that our decisions about what <cite data-term="treatment">treatments</cite> to use are based on <cite data-term="fair comparisons of treatments">fair tests</cite> of their <cite data-term="treatment effect">effects</cite>.</p>
    	<p>Here is an <cite>example</cite> of a missing term.</p>
